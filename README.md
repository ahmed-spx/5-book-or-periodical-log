In this lab for my CSE 1322 Programming Problem Solving II at Kennesaw State University, we covered these topics.

1. Object Oriented programming concepts
2. Abstract classes
3. Polymorphism

In this Lab I created three classes and a driver program. The first class, the parent, is an abstract class called Item. The other two classes, the children, inherit from the parent class and are called Book and Periodicals. Finally, created a test class called myCollection.
